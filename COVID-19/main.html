    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This visualization was designed and implemented to answer Q1: â€œAnalyze the spread trend of this virus all
        over the world. What is the spread over time?" It plots temporal data of COVID-19 cases onto a world map to
        show the spread trend across countries and territories.
    </p>
    <p>
        It makes use of the provided database to demonstrate incremented cases everyday from Dec. 31st, 2019 to Apr.
        15th, 2020. While incremented cases suggest more about developing trend of COVID-19 in particular countries, it is accumulated
        cases that unveil an overall situation of trend of this virus. Instead of using data from WHO as mentioned in Part one,
        Two new columns/attributes were added to the original database by accumulating previous incremented number of cases,
        because WHO data were written in reports but not separate file. After preprocessing, all the data were stored in one .csv file and later
        transformed to js object with d3. After rendering the world map, data were linked by country names to fill in color.
        As time slider moves, new data were rebound to fill in new colours.
    </p>
    <h2>Interactions</h2>
    <p>
        Animation was used to demonstrate the "trend" of COVID-19 around the world. It is automatically played but you can
        control it by dragging the slider left and right to pivot the time point you want. When you hover the cursor on the map,
        corresponding data would be shown with country name so that you can get the detailed number of data. Besides, two selectors were
        used to fully explore data. There are four combination of presentation modes in total: increased infected cases,
        increased deaths, accumulated infected cases and accumulated deaths.

    <p>
        The map visualization was based on a project called <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth">Choropleth</a>
        and the time slider component was modified from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-wealth-health-of-nations">this</a>.
        Besides the provided database about COVID-19, an extra <a href="https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas">database</a> describing geographical information of countries was used.
